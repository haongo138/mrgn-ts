## Creating Permissionless Banks

With marginfi permissionless banks, you can create your own isolated bank for any token you want backed by any collateral you want. What's more is that you don't need to be a developer to get started! Using <Button href="https://docs.marginfi.com/rust-sdk" variant="text"><>the marginfi CLI</></Button>, you can create your own permissionless bank today!

### Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Permissionless Bank with No Code

**Step 1**. Install the CLI

Before you begin, ensure that you have the marginfi CLI installed. If you haven't installed it yet, you can find the installation instructions in the <Button href="https://docs.marginfi.com/rust-sdk" variant="text"><>CLI documentation</></Button>.

**Step 2**. Use the Bank Creation Command

Using the CLI, type the command `mfi group add-bank`. This command initializes the process of creating a new bank within your group. You will be prompted to provide several arguments to set up your bank correctly.

A group represents a lending pool with a set of rules and configurations. It acts as a container for multiple lending banks, each with its own settings. The group defines the overall parameters for the lending and borrowing activities within its scope.

We create a bank using the `add-bank` subcommand under `group` because the group serves as the overarching structure that manages and coordinates the individual banks.

```bash
error: The following required arguments were not provided:
    --mint <MINT>
    --asset-weight-init <ASSET_WEIGHT_INIT>
    --asset-weight-maint <ASSET_WEIGHT_MAINT>
    --liability-weight-init <LIABILITY_WEIGHT_INIT>
    --liability-weight-maint <LIABILITY_WEIGHT_MAINT>
    --deposit-limit-ui <DEPOSIT_LIMIT_UI>
